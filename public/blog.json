[  {    "id": 1,    "question": "When should you use context API?",    
"answer": "Context API is useful when you have data that needs to be passed down through multiple levels of components in a React application. It provides a way to avoid prop drilling and makes it easier to share data between components.Suppose we have many component like 50 component. IF i need to pass data the main first componet to the last 50 number comonent when how can we pass the data? is Props Driling ? No thats a complex system. We can easy pass the any child element without propos driling the helping of CONTEXT API. At first create a context then the element should wrap the Context and set value what we pass though and at the end when we recieved there is use useContaxtApi to get to pass value.  ",

{    "id": 3,    "question": "What is useRef?",    "answer": "useRef is a built-in hook in React that provides a way to create a mutable variable that persists across renders. It can be used to store a reference to a DOM element, manage state that doesn't trigger re-renders, and more. useRef initialValue is a built-in React hook that accepts one argument as the initial value and returns a reference.A reference is an object having a special property current.There are 2 main rules usehref one of is The value of the reference is persisted remains unchanged between component re-renderings; and the other of is Updating a reference doesn't trigger a component re-rendering.",    "img": "https://i2.wp.com/blog.alexdevero.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-05-21-reacts-useref-hook-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it-blog.jpg?w=1024&ssl=1"  },  

{    "id": 4,    "question": "What is useMemo?",    "answer": "useMemo is a built-in hook in React that provides a way to optimize the performance of expensive computations by memoizing their results. It works by caching the result of a function and only recalculating it if the inputs to the function change. So we can call that useMemo that allows we to memoize expensive functions so that we can avoid calling them on every render. If we say what is the main purporpose of the use momo ? then the answes is thhe basic purpose of the useMemo hook is related to the fact that we try to avoid the unnecessary re-rendering of components and props in our program.",    "img": "https://i0.wp.com/everyday.codes/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/a.jpg?w=1200&ssl=1"  }]
